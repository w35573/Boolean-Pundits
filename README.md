### About the project
- Our Mission
Our mission is to provide quality education to underprivileged students and to create opportunities for them to reach their full potential. We aim to achieve this by providing access to resources such as textbooks, school supplies, and educational programs.
- How We Operate
We partner with local schools and organizations to identify students in need and to provide them with the resources necessary for a quality education. Our programs include after-school tutoring, mentorship, and workshops to help students succeed academically and develop important life skills.
